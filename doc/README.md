# ETUI

ETUI is short for ellos' terminal user interface. It's similar to ncurses in design except it has more modern features.

Use this in your projects if you want, but as of now I promise a deranged lack of stability. Mostly will use in my own projects. Was also originally developed for my (now deprecated and abandoned) music player.
